    <h1>Easy Lasagne Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/Lasagna.jpg" alt="Lasagna">
        <p>One hour from start-to-finish (and half of that's in the oven) and you can be serving up a big meaty-cheesy dish of lasagne, with enough for second helpings. Because we all want second helpings when it comes to lasagne right?</p>

        <p> Serve it with a big salad (I LOVE sliced red onions, crisp lettuce and some crunchy sliced radishes in my side salad) and some buttery garlic bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion - peeled and finely diced</li>
            <li> 2 cloves garlic - peeled and minced</li>
            <li> 1 carrot - peeled and finely diced</li>
            <li>3 chestnut (brown) mushrooms - finely diced</li>
            <li>500 g (1 lb) minced beef (ground beef)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp tomato puree</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 beef stock cube - crumbled</li>
            <li>800 g (2 x 400g/14oz) tinned chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li> ½ tbsp light brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Ragu</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the onion softens.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for a further minute</li>
            <li>Add the carrot and mushrooms and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the minced beef and cook for 5-6 minutes, until browned. Stir often, breaking up any large chunks of meat with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato puree, oregano, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock cube, tinned tomatoes, brown sugar, salt and pepper. Stir and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 -20 minutes until thickened.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Béchamel Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 200C/400F and start on the Béchamel Sauce:</li>
            <li>In a medium sized saucepan, add the butter and melt over a medium heat. </li>
            <li>Once melted and bubbling slightly, add in the flour and whisk it into the butter.</li>
            <li>Keep gently whisking the roux over the heat for one or two minutes to cook the flour. Add in a good splash of milk, turn up the heat and stir with the whisk to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Keep adding in the milk a good splash at a time, and whisking until all the milk is used up (this normally takes me about 3 or 4 minutes and I add the milk in about 5 splashes). Don't worry if you get a few lumps, keep stirring with the whisk and they will disappear as the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring the sauce with the whisk over the heat until your sauce thickens. Once thickened, add in the salt & pepper and cheddar. Stir together and then turn off the heat.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Now it's time to construct your lasagne</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the meat sauce into the lasagne dish and flatten it so it covers the base. You don't need much - this is just to ensure the lasagne sheets don't stick to the bottom of your dish. Then cover with 4 lasagne sheets. Try to ensure they don’t overlap. You may need to break up one of the sheets to cover the dish fully.</li>
            <li>Spoon on a third of the béchamel sauce and spread it around to cover the lasagne sheets, </li>
            <li>Then cover with a third of the remaining meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Place a layer of lasagne sheets on top. Followed by a layer of béchamel sauce and meat sauce. Repeat one more time, until all of the sauce and lasagne sheets are used.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the mixed cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes until the cheese is golden and the lasagne is bubbling slightly at the edges. </li>
            <li>Take out of the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes before sprinkling with parsley and serving.</li>
        </ol>
